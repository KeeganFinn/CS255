Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was what the entire class was guided around. We started by reading a transcript of an interview with the client, DriverPass, and ended with a final plan on how to create an online drivers education learning management system for them. The learning management system for this particular company required mobile and desktop support as well as online testing, scheduling, grade checking and a way to make scheduling changes. Since DriverPass prefered to use rented hardware for a server, the scalabilty of this project was basically unlimited as long as the funds were available.

What did you do particularly well?

I think I did a good job at sifting through the interview and picking out what the company wants with their product. I also think by using this information, I can decide if there might be something left out or not thought of by the company that could end up being an easily added, quality of life feature.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think all of my diagrams could be improved. I think this partly because diagram creation is not my stong point as of now. Also, using free LucidChart for creating diagrams would not be ideal in a real work setting.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Implementing the users needs into a system is very important because the user is the entire reason the system is being created. If a system, like a learning management system, is designed without the user in mind, it will inevitably fail. This is because a user trying to learn needs to feel comfortible with all available features within the system.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Gathering as much information on the program that is being created is the first big step towards the right direction in software design. Creating diagrams to plan out the program is also very helpful. I like to think of the different diagrams created to explain how the software can be coded or how the software can be used as roadmaps for the developers. As long as the diagrams are created with every requirement in mind, in a clear manner, then the diagrams will show exactly what the program needs and how it will work.
